# school-projects

Here are is a selection of programming assignments I did for schoolwork. Most of them are in Java or Python.

## CSE 5522 labs

Python programs analyzing data using artificial intelligence methods like the Viterbi algorithm, Naive Bayes classifiers, and far more. Available as .ipynb files (openable with Google Colab, recommended) and alternatively as .py files (Python code).

More coming soon.
